Make sure to replace "your_libass_library", "/path/to/your/libass/library", and "/path/to/your/libass/headers" with the appropriate values specific to your libass installation.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the setup.py file.

Run the following command to build the Cython extension module:

```
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

After the build completes, you should have a modify_subs.so file (on Linux/Mac) or modify_subs.pyd file (on Windows) generated in the same directory.
Now, you can import and use the modify_subs_py function in your Python code as follows:

```
import modify_subs

subfile = "your_subtitles.ass"
modify_subs.modify_subs_py(subfile)
```

Ensure that the modify_subs.so (or modify_subs.pyd) file and the libass library files are in the same directory as your Python script or accessible via the system's library paths.

Note that you need to replace "your_subtitles.ass" with the actual path to your SSA file. Additionally, make sure to replace "your_libass_library", "/path/to/your/libass/library", and "/path/to/your/libass/headers" with the correct values according to your libass installation.
